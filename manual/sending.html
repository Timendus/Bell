				<h2>Sending over data</h2>
				
				<h3>Using send and receive</h3>
				
				<p>If you want to send over some data from one calculator to another (in one direction) or you haven't called <kbd>bell_connect</kbd>, you can use the send and receive routines to transfer bytes, blocks of data or strings. All you have to do is call <kbd>bell_sendXXX</kbd> on one calculator and the corresponding <kbd>bell_recvXXX</kbd> on the other at approximately the same time (within the timeout delay) and the routines will do the rest. A demonstration of how to send over "Hello world":</p>
				
				<div class="code">	call bell_sync	; synchronize
	ret nz		; return if clear was pressed
	or a		; which calculator are we?
	jp nz,receive	; if we're the second connected calc,
			; receive the string
	
send:			; otherwise; send the string
	ld hl,string
	call bell_sendString
	ret

receive:
	ld hl,saferam1	; receive the string to some buffer
	call bell_recvString
	ret nz		; return if a transmission error occured
	bcall(_clrLCDFull)
	ld hl,saferam1
	bcall(_puts)	; display the string
	bcall(_getkey)	; wait for a keypress
	ret		; and return
	
string:
	.db "Hello world!",0</div>
				
				<h3>Using swap</h3>
				
				<p>Swapping data is much easier in situations where both calculators are more or less equal and they need to exchange the same kind of data (a game for example). You just call <kbd>bell_swapXXX</kbd> on both calculators at approximately the same time (within the timeout delay) and the routine will swap the data for you. A demonstration of how to use this will be given in the form of a simple game.</p>
