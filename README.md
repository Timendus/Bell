Bell
====

Bell is a data link layer library for z80 Texas Instruments calculators. The main goal of Bell is to provide programmers with a set of routines to transfer data as fast as possible between two calculators. Secondary goals include ease of use, reliablility, useful error reporting and completeness.

This is a very old project of mine, which is here so I don't lose it :)
